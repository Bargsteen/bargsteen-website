          <summary>Misadventuring, hobo-style! // Bye Bye Dei 18&frasl;07 - Chapter Nine We looked up the rules for sleeping in parks in Nice. It was illegal. We did it anyway. Desperate times calls for tents in parks! A weird sound woke us up, sort of a &lsquo;clunk clunk&rsquo;. What the hell is that?! Turned out that our park was filled with petanque fields, and the sound came from an early bird training his skills.</summary>

          <summary>It&rsquo;s Nice here 17&frasl;07 - Chapter Eight It was melting hot day to hitchhike in, and maybe that&rsquo;s why we failed. Wait what!? Yes, our semi-boiling brains gave in to the temptation of BlaBlaCar. Sorry to disappoint, but we had good a reason - Herbie Hancock was playing in Nice! We had bought tickets a few days before and were ready to end our trip with a jazzy explosion of augmented chords, improvisation and a Nice atmosphere (sorry for the pun :b).</summary>

I woke up with a mild hangover and sneaked out of the tent. The others were still asleep, and I went for a morning swim in the lovely water. A little later, our friends, the strangers, cooked us a nice breakfast and brewed some extremely strong coffee.</summary>

This is the story of how a hot and unlucky (hitchhiking wise) start in Paris turned into a row joyous encounters. It all started out with us leaving our hostel in the morning. Hopeful and sweaty we walked towards the highway. Our plan was simple: let&rsquo;s go south!</summary>

          <summary>I can has wine!? 13&frasl;07 - Chapter Four Slighty hungover, we managed to get out of our lovely private hotel room and down to one of the best-rated cafés for brunch. Plane tickets were bought (yes we are cheating on our way back, but more about that later), food digested and coffee drunk. Then we moved onto discovering the city. We found the Luxembourg Park, which was quite nice and relaxing.</summary>

The videoes and photos explain it quite well, so I&rsquo;ll let them do most of the talking this time around. As they say: &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;, and those videos are 2:05 minutes long in total. Which means 125 seconds &#42; 30 frames per sec &#42; 1000 words per pic = 3.</summary>

It had it all, to say the least, but we slept none the less. I, Dizzy, woke up before Diama and took a little video explaining my thoughts and actions to come. So here it comes. Video content, as promised. (Dizzys and Diamas always pay their debts (and keep their promises).</summary>
