Hi! My name is Kasper Dissing Bargsteen. I study Software Engineering at Aalborg University in Denmark. I recently finished my bachelor and will soon embark on the journey of mastering the subject ;) In my spare time I enjoy music, travel, math, photography. I spend my days learning new and wonderful things in most domains of life, but especially the ones mentioned before. I play the guitar, piano, and sing. And Haskell is becoming my weapon of choice in terms of programming.

This website is meant as an all in one blog combining all of my interests. Should you not find all my interests equally, well interesting, then do not hesitate to skip over any blog posts! I won't mind, and probably will never find out.

Have a great day, and remember to learn something new today and every day!

Cheers, 
Kasper
