title: About
---

My name is Kasper Dissing Bargsteen. I study software engineering at Aalborg University, Denmark. But that is not all that I do. I love music, travel, photography, and as is stated somewhere else on this site - life!

This page will probably change a bit when I get more time. Currently, I am spending all my time on my new company [Adali](https://adali.dk/), which I started with some friends. We are creating learning products for schools and high schools, which support active and differentiated learning. Read more about it on our website ;)!

Cheers Kasper
